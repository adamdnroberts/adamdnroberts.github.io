I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of Rochester. My research focuses on the comparative politics of developing countries, with a particular emphasis on Latin America. I am also interested in quantitative research methods. I earned my BA in Political Science/Economics from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 2021.
