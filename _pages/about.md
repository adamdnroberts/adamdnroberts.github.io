I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of Rochester and a Democracy Center Graduate Fellow for the 2025-2026 academic year. My research studies electoral accountability and political behavior in developing democracies, with a focus on Mexico. I am also interested in quantitative research methods. I earned my BA in Political Science/Economics from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 2021.

I have an incredibly common name! To clarify, I am not Emeritus Professor [Sir Adam Roberts](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Roberts_(scholar)>), the science fiction novelist [Adam Charles Roberts](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Roberts_(British_writer)>), or any of [these Adam Robertses](<https://adamdnroberts.github.io/adam_roberts_directory/>).
