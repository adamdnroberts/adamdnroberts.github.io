      This dataset provides information on the national composition of European Commission staff between 2011 and 2022. Each observation records the number of staff of a given nationality at a specific date, disaggregated across Directorate-Generals (DGs), services, and task forces within the Commission. The data were collected from the European Union’s human resources reports, converted from PDF format, and aggregated into a structured panel dataset. This enables systematic analysis of staffing patterns and geographic representation within the EU bureaucracy over time.
